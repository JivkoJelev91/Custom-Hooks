## What are React Hooks ?
Official Intro -> https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html

In poor words, with use******** you are injecting @ runtime during render phase a piece of (state, didMount, didUpdate, unMount) just in one line of code, without collision with eventually already existing state and lifecycle of your components.
You can think Hooks like Mixin without Mixin drawbacks, because of Runtime Injection&Isolation.

## Why Hooks?
Share Business Logic (piece of (state, didMount, didUpdate, unMount)) between components in one line of code.
Does it have a performance cost? Of course, injecting @ runtime have always a cost. So Why?
Share Business Logic (piece of (state, didMount, didUpdate, unMount)) beetween components in one line of code.
